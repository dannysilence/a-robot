## Overview
Arduino based robot repo, _a_ in a-robot means Arduino :)
Here there is an Arduino based code for Gamepad (BleJoystick) and RoboCar (later also for RoboTank like Devastator).


### Prerequisites

[Romeo BLE](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1176.html)
[Arduino Gamepad](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-858.html)
[Bluno Bee for Gamepad](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1073.html)
[RC Car](https://www.argos.co.uk/product/6801849)

You may use other RC car (in fact we need wheels, motors and body only - all the controls are handled by Arduino, so  if you have broken RC car - it may work for this case ideally)

You may also not buy Arduino Gamepad (or buy already BLE version) - instead of any Gamepad there is an app (based on DFRobot BlunoBasicDemo) to handle same kind of actions as from Gamepad - follow [Android Gamepad App](https://github.com/dannysilence/BlunoBasicDemo) and build the app (or get Release APK from [here](https://github.com/dannysilence/BlunoBasicDemo/releases/tag/1.0)) for yourself.
